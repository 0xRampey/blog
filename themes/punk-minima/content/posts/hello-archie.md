## Config

### Theme config

Cause Zola limited custom config must under the `extra` field, so there are some different with the origin theme:

Demo website config.toml:

```toml
# control dark mode: auto | dark | toggle
mode = "toggle"

# subtitle will show under the title in index page
subtitle = "A zola theme forked from [archie](https://github.com/athul/archie)"

# if set true, will use external CDN resource to load font and js file
useCDN = false

favicon = "/icon/favicon.png"

# show in the footer
copyright = "keith"

# config your Google Analysis ID
ga = "XXXX-XXXXX"

# optional: config your i18n entry
[extra.translations]
languages = [{name = "en", url = "/"}]

# config multi-language menu and other text
[[extra.translations.en]]
show_more = "Read more ⟶"
previous_page = "← Previous"
next_page = "Next →"
posted_on = "on "
posted_by = "Published by"
read_time = "minute read"
all_tags = "All tags"
menus = [
    { name = "Home", url = "/", weight = 2 },
    { name = "All posts", url = "/posts", weight = 2 },
    { name = "About", url = "/about", weight = 3 },
    { name = "Tags", url = "/tags", weight = 4 },
]

# config social icon info in the footer
[[extra.social]]
icon = "github"
name = "GitHub"
url = "https://github.com/XXXMrG/archie-zola"

[[extra.social]]
icon = "twitter"
name = "Twitter"
url = "https://github.com/your-name/"

[[extra.social]]
icon = "gitlab"
name = "GitLab"
url = "https://gitlab.com/your-name/"

```

### Content config

**In content/posts/\_index.md. I use Zola config: transparent = true to implement the pagination**

In Zola, you can use config in the \_index.md to control pagination and sort post list:

```toml
paginate_by = 3
sort_by = "date"

[taxonomies]
tags = ["FE", "Rust"]

[extra]
author = { name = "XXXMRG", social= "https://github.com/XXXMrG" }
```

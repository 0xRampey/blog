### [kitty]()

A fast, GPU-powered terminal emulator. My fav one so far. It's cross-platform so I can use the same config files everywhere. Apart from being quick, Its quick to simple and it has some neat features like:

-   Startup sessions that can set multiple tabs and their layouts and also run scripts (think ssh, ) so that your workflow is initialised as soon as you start developing.
-   Little things like copy-on-select, ctrl-c copies when text is selected else destroyer of processes, ctrl-v doesnt require shift. Shaved a few seconds off my life.

### [Hammerspoon]() (Mac only)

Automates your Mac workflows with simple Lua scripting. Extremely powerful, Ive barely scrathced the surface. I use it to quickly open my most used apps: Command+1 for Chrome, +2 for kitty and so on and so forth. Very handy. Oh and swapped ctrl with caps lock coz its easier to reach for them terminal commands

## Writing

### [Roam Research]()

The best tools are the one make you change your lifestyle for the better. With Roam and its brilliant ocmmunity of devs and extensions,

-   Cannot recommend this enough. I simply write **more** because the barrier has been drastically lowered. Before I had to think about how to organize something before I wrote it down, now I just write it in a jpurnal entry and backlink the keywords for future reference. RIP Evernote.
-   Spaced repetition and the notes I make are all in one place.
-   I wake up to Roam Research: hash out the day's agenda, learn flashcards, write some thiyughts down and get to work.

### [Typora]()

My new favourite tool for markdown writing. Elegant interface that handles **image sizing** very well.

I've started using it to write my blogs.

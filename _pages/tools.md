A fast, GPU-powered terminal emulator. My favourite one so far. It's cross-platform so I can use the same config files everywhere. Apart from being quick, it has some neat features like:

-   Startup sessions that can set multiple tabs and layouts and run custom commands (think ssh, curl) so that your workflow is initialised as soon as you start developing.
-   Little things like copy-on-select or ctrl-c/ctrl-v without the shift are convenient.

### [Roam Research]()

The best tools are the one make you change your lifestyle for the better. With Roam and its brilliant ocmmunity of devs and extensions,

-   Cannot recommend this enough. I simply write **more** because the barrier has been drastically lowered. Before I had to think about how to organize something before I wrote it down, now I just write it in a journal entry and backlink the keywords for future reference. RIP Evernote.
-   Spaced repetition and the notes I make are all in one place.
-   I wake up to Roam Research: hash out the day's agenda, learn flashcards, write some thoughts down and get to work.

### [Typora]()

My new favourite tool for markdown writing. Elegant interface that handles **image sizing** very well.

I've started using it to write my blogs.

### [Hammerspoon]()

Automate your Mac workflows with simple Lua scripting. Extremely powerful but I've barely scratched the surface. I use it to quickly open my most used apps: Command+1 for Chrome, +2 for kitty and so on and so forth. Very handy. Oh and swapped the ctrl key with caps lock coz its easier to reach for them terminal commands.

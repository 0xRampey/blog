I need a smoothie which is micro nutrient rich but also tasty and protein rich. 
Here's what I have in mind:

- 1 cup of Gold standard chocolate whey 
- 30g of baby spinach (1 cup): Increase upto 50g if you are not bothered by taste.
- 1 tbsp of Flax seeds: 2 tbsp seems op timal but they really change up the taste 
-

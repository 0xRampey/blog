Hi there, my name is Prudhvi Rampey. 
Some things I believe in:
- Blockchains incentivize people towards programmable goals.
- Building and writing are the best ways to learn.
- Customers always follow the path of least cost. 
- Failing gracefully is the key to growth, in the gym and in life. 

I run crypto experiments at [Lever Capital](https://github.com/LeverCapital/anon-my-rpc). Also did some blockchain stuff at OpenPool and Pocket Network. Check my resume [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ynzqdzz7llav08ut8ock3/Blockchain_Resume.pdf?rlkey=59cfr5atwzvd8fjciwzacl1p1&dl=0) for more info.

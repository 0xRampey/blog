Hi there, my name is Prudhvi Rampey.
I'm currently working at the intersection of distributed systems, web assembly and zero-knowledge proofs.

Some things I believe in:
- Shared, distributed ledgers bring people together to do absolutely anything.
- Prove once, verify anywhere, trust no one.
- Failing gracefully is the key to growth in the gym, in life and in Rust.
- Users will always follow the path of least cost and most convenience.

During the day, I help developers build software on Ethereum using their favourite language, at [Stackr Labs](https://stf.xyz). In my spare time, I conduct crypto experiments at [Lever Capital](https://github.com/LeverCapital/anon-my-rpc).

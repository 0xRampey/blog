Hi there, my name is Prudhvi Rampey. 
I love building and writing: the 2 most effective ways to learn. 

This blog's name is inspired from Daniel Kahneman's book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. It talks about two ways of thinking: System 1 is fast and intuitive; System 2 is slower and more deliberative. I attempt to follow the latter in this blog.

My current interests include Decentralised Finance, investing and cryptography. Check out some DeFi experiments I run at [Lever Capital](https://sigma-ui.on.fleek.co/#/perp-vaults).
